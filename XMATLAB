It is not highly recommended, but if a user wants to do X-Windows forwarding with MATLAB, it can be done.

If the user is not using a Linux local machine they will need to install an X-windows client, such as Xming for MS-Windows or X11 on Mac OSX from the XQuartz project.

ssh <username>@spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au -X
sinteractive --x11=first
module load MATLAB/2017a
matlab

.... and wait!

When the MATLAB window finally appears, you can type in commands as usual. As a test, try typing in the polarplot.m commands.
